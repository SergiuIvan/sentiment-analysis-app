And seems like boat just focussed on bass for these earphones. Note my words just and just bass, too much bass for long time will surely give u headache. I bought these for 999/- but i don't think so they are worth that. My senhessier cx wired earphones are way too much better than these, way too much. So if u want to buy these then buy only for the sake of wireless feature and not for the sound and build quality.",

Mine replaced for two times till now for it's power button issue. It will take 20 days to replace the product. First time after 20 days of purchaseing and then after three months.

It may take a while to connect back with a Windows 10 laptop.Battery is okay. Can't take it off the whole day.Don't expect noise cancellation. Sound is great. You can enjoy bass.

Additionally I have a Philips basic, a Sony and a JBL headphone. I have bought these for my own use, a few friends and relatives. None of these can compare to the loudness bass and overall effect of these bt earphones. I'm obviously not an audiophile but I know the difference between a good sound and noise. The only concern I found was that the wires hang a lil low and the highs could have been sharper(nitpicking). Cant fault it otherwise. I have It paired with RN5 pro.",

Skull Candy wire length was perfect. In Boats Rockerz, because the wire is too long, it keeps bumping against my neck when i run. The sound of the wire hitting the neck echoes in the ear pieces. Also, when i do floor exercises, the longish wire hangs uncomfortably around the neck. Sound quality and battery life is decent for the price, though. So if you plan to buy it for casual listening, go ahead. Wouldn't recommend for serious workouts.",

I found it very clear not comparable to Hi-res earphones (ofcourse). It has good amount of bass but not deep bass instead more of a muddy bass but what else can you expect at this price. But it is good for casual music but i found it little weird for watching movies. Connectivity is ok . Not great cause if you'll put your phone behind your body like in case u keep ur phone in your back pockets , the  connection gets lost. Moreover , since it's a  Bluetooth 4.1 even the range is around 10m or less. Build quality seems good but only time can tell that. I have another boat product called Boat Rockerz 600 ( it was their flagship product then) , which is a very good product. I have it for more than an year now and it's still running very strong though i don't use it as my daily driver. Only problem is that it's earpads are in really bad shape so i have similar hopes with this product too. And if you are confused between this or other similarly priced earphones like Boult, tagg and all don't bother they all are Chinese earphones re-branded and marketed as Boat or tagg etc. So i believe they should sound very similar. And the MRP written on them is basically a maketing gimmick. There's no way these kinda earphones could cost more than INR1500.And now for \" Audiophiles\" ,well if you are one , you won't be looking at these anyway. So that's it . Happy shopping.",

This is worth its price... Hope the packaging was good ...there was no bubble wrapping..",

    "review": "Review update - Product failed after a few months\n Update: Sadly this is the second Boat product to conk off after few months of use. I guess this is the end of the journey for you and I Boat Audio, not buying any more products from your brand. Changed the rating to reflect the same.I was in the market for a cheap pair of Bluetooth earphones and I chanced upon this on a lightning deal and bought it. I have used Boat products before, they have good build quality and their sound is alright. I’m writing this after a month or so, enough time to have lived with it and get to know quirks and other problems.• The sound is nothing great, it’s a bit on the bassy side. If you’re a bass lover, this is definitely a good buy.• Connectivity is quick and painless – and it works without hassle every time. The quality of the connectivity depends and is sometimes weird. I can put the phone on charge and use it for a distance of about 3 meters, no worries. But sometimes when I’m walking really fast or jogging there are breaks and crackles in audio. Not sure if it’s the material of my gym wear, but it works well when the phone’s in my jeans.• Battery life is nothing to write home about – I listen to music constantly even when I’m at work. My demands are probably too high for this price range.• It is sweat-proof as advertised. No interruptions under a light drizzle.• It’s got great build quality for the price – looks and feels premium. Doesn’t tangle at all.• It stays in your ear regardless of the intensity of the exercise which is great.On the whole a great buy if you are looking for a cheaper alternative. Wait for a sale before you get it though.Like my reviews? Please do click the helpful button. It encourages me to share more about the products I use. Thanks!",

And the price does justifies its quality but for music purposes it does lags. Bass is still justified for its price. Basic functions dont work as desired like overriding the use of buttons.  The startup and shutting down voice is very annoying. Could have kept very subtle.And also battery drains out quickly.  The microphone is the worst.  The person at the other end wont be able to hear you clearly. The built quality is very cheap.  Dont expect it to be durable for long just keep it safe.Also when I used it during running the audio started to interrupt regularly which was very very annoying. I had to abstain from using it during morning jog.  After this experience am giving it only 2 stars.",

Mic quality is decent and battery life is about 6-7 hours of playback. Noise cancellation is pretty enough. I am very impressed from these earphones.

Sits comfortably around the neck, earpiece is good, and feels sturdy.Noise cancellation is surprisingly good at this price range (during phone calls person on the other end hears very less background noise.)Sound quality - good with Android. With iPhone the sound tends to get crackling at high volumes when equaliser is on. No complains on flat sound.Wires are a bit long, but you get used to it after a while.My only issue with this and other BT earphones in this price bracket is with the voice breaking. If I keep my phone in my pocket (jeans) and walk the audio starts to break and I have to reposition the neckband. This has happened quite a number of times. I used to own a Tagg inferno and MiVi thunderbeats, both had this issue and this one too.To summarise, worth buying, if under 1500.",

Immediately opened the package to see how the condition was, however it came in a well packed box and on top of it Amazon's insulated cover with invoice. Opened the headphone and put charging through laptop for a few minutes and started using it.Pros:1. Connecting to my new OnePlust 6T within no time and giving a sound with a bold voice stating \"You are now connected to Boat Rocerz 255\"2. Base is really awesome, able to hear vocals properly, well mounted ear tips helps you to use the headphone for longer time3. Call quality is fine and more over noise cancellation is ok4. Music is so good to listen while driving.Cons:1. Multi-functional is not so compatible to my phone (it's my assumption), where I could not able to got to the next song or previous song.2. Noise Cancellation is not that much awesome but yeah can able to listen our voice properly by the other side.3. If we give pause for 5 minutes to the song while listening through this, you should go back again to your phone to replay it againOverall it's a satisfactory deal and worth every rupee we spend on it. As this is my second product from Boat I strongly recommend this.",

The seller is selling us version 4.1. Please amazon correct it!! Customers would face the loss in case of any mis communication.Talking about build quality, sound clarity and looksI personally liked it.. Bass is really good no noise while hearing. If you are listening into a good melody songs you would dive into the music. Look wise as depicted in pictures it looks different from the black and red..I use for jogging and excersise and the fit is good.. it won't get dropped off.Battery is ok I am getting around 6 hrs in a one full charge.

Bought this after seeing 4 star rating from amazon users but seriously not worth 4 stars.1. Bass may be there but the sound is not powerfull and sharp. I tried to switch between plug in ear phone and boat wireless and found that the sound is not great although bass may be there.2. As some user has mentioned the mic is not good which i also feel3. If you arr looking for style then it doesn't look stylish. The earphone wires should come from behind not front as it looks odd.4. Noise cancellation is good.5. Ear comfort is ok.If i have to buy again i would rather by wireless earphone at 600 bucks from metro station amd may feel disappointed rather than spending 1500 buck and feeling disappointed.This product should be in the range of 600  to 800 maxStill if you need something desperately wireless and at some affordable cost then its ok.Have heard from some colleagues that you may find some good wireless earphone from Ali express",

Bass is on point and battery life is approx 8-9 hours. You hardly feel it in your ears.  Mic picks up all the noise so thats one minus but you can still hear the the sound. Mic is very sensitive so you can speak almost for yourself and still other person will get you.",

The earphone is wireless which takes away all the things !It’s quiet light weight ! And the price is just awesome for the same. The earphone is very easy to connect and it’s quiet reliable too! One can wear whole day and won’t even feel them. The sound quality is more over on the base side.

So its just the first day review. But performance is good.Earphones looks solid. Build quality is good. The magnates are really helpful to hold the earphones. Earphones looks great.Earphone wire could be bit long. But that's fine for me. Not sure about others.Didn't get chance to charge so not sure about the time to full charge.One thing i observed during my 10 hours play time that the music stopped playing itself in middle. Not sure it it gets disconnected or there is some technical problem.But overall performance was nice. Good experience.",

    "review": "One of the worst earphone I’ve had\n I’ve been using this for past few months now.At first glance, the product seems good and because it does its purpose as wireless audio earphone.Operation wise, there are few things that annoys me a lot.1. During charging there’s no LED indicator. So sometimes if cable is loose or something you won’t know that it’s not charging.2. The on/off switch is not UX friendly. you can’t tell by touch if you’re pressing  volume buttons or power button. All Buttons are diamond shaped. Extremely annoying when you’re in a hurry.3. The Bluetooth pairing is not intuitive. You have to switch on phone Bluetooth and then the earphone. If you switch on the earphone and then the phone Bluetooth, the earphone won’t initiate pairing(I know it’s not the problem with iPhone, because my previous Bluetooth used to work this way) . This is very stupid. So you have to re-start the earphone.4. Double press on volume buttons doesn’t perform next/previous function. Other earphones are capable of this very basic function.5. Occasional buzz or distortion. Sometimes there is a buzzing distortion. On restart of the earphone it goes away.",

Thats fine as initial product charged battery full and started using it ..It started reconnecting most of time and sound started disappearing . I checking the range on the manual which said 10m and i saw when i placed my mobile in shirts pocket it was perfect and working and when i moved it to pants pocket it disconnected and reconnected . and it kept happening with 100% charge and was totally waste of time and value for this .Tried many times and got to know its very small range one and doesnt come with proper range.",

    "review": "The “Boat” experience !!\n I feel they are the best in the business. They have come out with exceptional quality, awesome product at the exact right price point. Awesome accoustic experience is what Boat provides and i would go so far to say that they are the Bose of their price point. I have been using Boat rockerz 250 in the past and those lasted well over 3 years while delivering exceptional music experience throughout. The battery started to give way after 2 yrs but that is expected of all these products. The 255 have better sound quality in terms of bass, accoustic, treble if compared to the 250.The wire is a bit too long for my liking but that’s probably cause i had gotten used to the short wire of the 250.I am sure these will again last me well over 2 years. My brother didn’t listen to me and bought noise shotz and he is regretting his decision now. Poor sound quality, battery quality, connection issues are some of the issues with the noise shotz.Everyone should give them a try once.I had skullcandy before and they were replaced by the company 4 times in the first year while the warranty was active and i had to throw them away after the warranty expired as the 5th piece also malfunctioned. The Boat experience though has been an awesome soundblowing experience.",

    "review": "Think twice before buying!!!\n I also own a Bose premium headphones which I think I cannot wear everyday to gym, so I bought this product for my day to day workouts. Comparing it with Bose, sound is not that crisp but for a Bluetooth earphone under 2k it worth it. I really like the beats and sound is pretty awesome too.Full marks for that, but I find it pretty annoying while working out in gym. There is a U shaped clip at the end of which two wires are attached which connects to earphones. The sturdy clip has to hang round your neck all the time. If you are running, the clip might start rotating and that would slowly force one of the earbud come of your ear. Pretty annoying...believe me, you have to turn the clip time and again to hang it around your neck in correct position. Also, while doing ab crunches it will keep on falling back and take both the earbuds along with it.I was mislead with the pictures, I thought it is all wire and no clip but its not. Just wanted to point this out so you dont make the same mistake ;)But if you are not into too much workout and want it for travel, then connection range and awesome beats is great deal.Cheers.",

Thanks Amazon and seller for initiating the refund. I am not a sound specialist but i am a good listener. My first lengthy review is below.Pros:1. BASS, really heavy bass.2. while listening to music, Double press invokes the last phone call . On the GO call. So when riding in bike it is useful to call my wife ;-)3. can use it when wearing a helmet.4. really good wires and sturdy. So life of the earphone is assured.5. Neck design if u like it.6. Easy to connect. Range/Connectivity is good even when there are many obstacles in between.Cons:1. Mic is at the end of the neck design i.e not closer to mouth. So the other person on the call can't hear properly. Mic picks up so many noise as no MEMS in this.2. Bass is not everything in music. Too much of bass. Even equalizer adjustments to reduce the bass does not help.3. Battery life is mediocre when compared to others.I have bought Mi basic bluetooth headset after returning this.Pros: Dynamic enjoyable bass even at higher volume, MIC noiseless,Cons: wire quality is poor. have to keep it carefully.CHEERS!!!",

I will try to cover all aspects of these earphones in this review.*Reliability:*The earphones get disconnected after some time if you don't use it for like 3-4 hours. It's very frustrating since you have to start the earphones first before picking up the call. Also, when you pick up the call you don't know whether to use phone or earphones to speak since you don't know whether they are connected. Though a small issue, it's really frustrating, trust me.*Experience:*The earphones are pretty useful and give all kinds of signals (if you have plugged it in your ear) like connected, disconnected, battery low. But what is most frustrating is the battery low signal which is not just a beep, but a long sentence it says \"Oops, battery low\". This keeps on repeating every 30 seconds which really annoys me. If the battery is low, it should just beep if they have to. But every time bugging is not a good experience.Also, it takes a bit too long to power on and power off. You have to press the button for like 5-7 seconds.*Sound Quality:*The first song I listened to these earphones sounded really terrible with high bass. But it's not really bad if you are not into too much sound details.*Build Quality:*Build quality is really good. No issues with that.*Battery life*Satisfied with battery life. But it doesn't last that long as promised. But I am okay with that.",

I found it difficult to place it initially, but I figured it out later. Now, after 3-4 days of use, my ear hurts because I have been placing them in ear. So that's a bad thing.4.

Other than that, it is not for music lovers who wants to listen to music for long hours. in 30 minutes it starts hurting and I started to develop ear/headache if I continue to listen more than 1 hr. Definitely not suitable for laptops - it keeps disconnecting frequently for no reason. Recently it starts doing the same with my mobiles as well. Battery is not great with daily 1 hours of hearing battery lasts max 3 days. The string is annoyingly long, it dangles upto your stomach. I have seen earphones with reasonable length, this one is awkwardly designed. You cannot wear them without getting attention from onlookers.If you are ready to spend another 1000 bucks go for good brands like JBL, Senheiser etc. If you want to cut cost, well this is the Best among the other worsts in the market",

When I use this for calls when I am in my room, my sound gets diffused in the sound my ceiling fan makes and the other party will be having lots of difficulty hearing us. And the ear pains a lot after half an hour of usage due to the ear-holder kind of thing provided on the buds. I won't recommend this to anyone. I read and watched a lot of reviews before buying this.

    "review": "Perfect for music\n The product design is really good, comfortable, lightweight. The color combination is perfect for the unisex collection. I picked a red and black combination. The noise cancellation for the call is good but not up to the mark. The biggest drawback I felt was I could not connect to my laptop via Bluetooth plus you cannot take calls from the headset. the buttons are to control the volume and play and pause the call.",

    "review": "Not working as expected\n Product received on time there is no issue.  Sharing my experience here for you to decide before you go for this product only.During calls suddenly it goes blank.There is no noise cancellation or its not working properly.  Always people on call ask me \"are you outside, we are getting so many noise\"I have ordered replacement, after 15 days i received serviced item (may be before that someone used and returned to boat), Same issue persist but now I don't know what to do... and I am not using this for important office calls.  Just using for hearing music & watching movies.  Replacement process is good, they only come and collect your product and return using courier, if you raise ticket online.  Problem rectified or not that's matter.Overall my suggestion / experience I could say \"Don't go for this product if you really want to use it for official purpose\"",
